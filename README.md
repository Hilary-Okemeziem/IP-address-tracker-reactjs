Live Demo: https://ipaddress-webtracker.vercel.app/

This IP address tracker was built with ReactJS and is hosted on Vercel.

I made use of IP Geolocation API for fetching the data for user IP address, location, timezone and Internet Service Provider.

The project also has an in-built map showing the user location which I implemented using react-leaflet from leafletjs.

The project was styled with Tailwind CSS.
