Live Demo: https://ipaddress-webtracker.vercel.app/

This IP address tracker was built with ReactJS and is hosted on Vercel.

Users are able to see their IP address and location on the map on page load and can search for another IP address and their location using the search bar.

I made use of IP Geolocation API for fetching the data for user IP address, location, timezone and Internet Service Provider.

The project also has an in-built map showing the user location which I implemented using react-leaflet from leafletjs.

The project was styled with Tailwind CSS.
